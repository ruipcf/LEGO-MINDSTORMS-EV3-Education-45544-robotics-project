# LEGO-MINDSTORMS-EV3-Education-45544-robotics-project
Development of robotic control for a robot using the educational kit 45544 from Lego in MATLAB capable of reading different sensors, acquiring an image from an external camera and deciding on it.

What robot can do:
  The robot is prepared (and it was tested) to self-drive avoiding obstacles by reading distance using an ultrasonic sensor, react to collisions using a touch sensor, and follow determined objects (in our case it must find a rectangle object inside of a triangle object) using an external camera using an app that connects to Matlab by IP.
  We also developed an interface that is easier to see what the robot is viewing.
  
  
What can be improved:
  The robot is also equipped with a color sensor which is designed to be able to follow a line. We developed the code for the same, but it has not yet been tested in the best conditions so it is not ready to be used. 
  Another objective would be when he found a certain color, he would change the direction so as not to go over it.
